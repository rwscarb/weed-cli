"""
NAT-traversal relay. A host with no reachable inbound port registers here
over one persistent outbound CONTROL connection; a downloader connects
here too and gets paired with a fresh DATA connection the host dials back
on demand (rathole/frp's rendezvous shape, hand-rolled to match this
repo's own wire protocol instead of pulling in an external tunnel tool).
From the moment a DATA connection is paired with a downloader connection,
this relay does nothing but shovel raw bytes between the two sockets — it
never parses node.py's INFO/LEAVES/FETCH protocol riding inside the
tunnel, same "dumb relay, no opinion on the payload" design as
discovery_relay.py, just for bytes instead of signed JSON events.

Rendezvous protocol — one plain-text first line per connection, then the
socket either stays line-based (REGISTER's control channel) or becomes a
raw pipe (CONNECT/DATA, once paired):

  REGISTER <token>          host -> relay, persistent control connection.
                             token is whatever the host wants to be found
                             under (node.py uses the archive's content_hash).
                             Replies OK, or ERR if another still-active
                             connection already holds this token (first
                             registration wins; no stealing an active one).
  CONNECT <token>           downloader -> relay, wants to reach that host.
                             Everything sent after this line IS the tunneled
                             protocol, not a relay command.
  NEWSTREAM <stream_id>     relay -> host, over the control connection:
                             "a downloader is waiting, dial back."
  DATA <stream_id>          host -> relay, the dial-back this relay pairs
                             with the waiting CONNECT. Everything after
                             this line is tunneled protocol too.

This relay has zero idea what `token` means — it's purely a lookup key,
same as content_hash is everywhere else in this repo.

    """Byte-at-a-time on purpose: CONNECT/DATA connections become a raw
    byte pipe immediately after this first line, and the real client
    (HostConnection.connect_via_tunnel) sends its next protocol command
    without waiting for any ack — a chunked recv() here could swallow
    those bytes along with the handshake line, leaving nothing for pipe()
    to forward. One byte at a time guarantees this stops exactly at the
    newline and never reads into what comes after. Only runs once per
    connection (a ~20-40 byte line), not on the hot path.

    The read timeout and length cap are specific to this one line, not
    the socket in general: a client that never sends a newline (or
    trickles bytes in one at a time forever) would otherwise tie up this
    thread's connection slot indefinitely, and daemon_threads has no cap
    on how many of those can pile up. Neither limit costs a real client
    anything — every genuine REGISTER/CONNECT/DATA line arrives
    immediately and is ~20-40 bytes. The timeout is cleared again before
    returning since callers keep using this same socket afterward:
    REGISTER's control connection sits idle between real downloads for
    as long as minutes or hours (see node.py's heartbeat), and pipe()
