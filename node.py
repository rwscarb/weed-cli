"""
The missing integration piece: a real node that hosts, discovers, and
downloads — not another isolated demo. Wires together pieces already built
tonight rather than reinventing them:

  - real chunk-serve protocol, extended from poc_network_challenge.py's
    holder (adds INFO/LEAVES so a downloader can learn the archive's shape
    before fetching)
  - real ott archives (same .ott/ format poc_real_archive_challenge.py
    read from, via `pip install btcvm`)
  - real signed events (Identity/sign_event from poc_reputation.py), now
    persisted to disk instead of regenerated fresh every run — a real node
    needs a stable identity across invocations
  - the same discovery relay protocol from discovery_relay.py

What's actually new here, not just wired: a real client-driven download —
every previous script verified chunks locally or over a network, none of
them reassembled a full file from a remote peer onto disk before this.

# needs ground-truth bytes the verifier already trusts, which a first-time
# downloader doesn't have yet (that's the whole point of downloading).
# Sample-verifying a few chunks via FETCH is what a fresh client can
# actually do independently, since LEAVES is already Merkle-root-checked
